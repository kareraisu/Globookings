IMPORTANT
. fix update save (backbone url error)
. fix time render when editing (if room is reselected time appears as booked)


CAN WAIT
. turn panels into tabs and collapse header menu when on xs viewport
. tweak mapster auto-resize values (buggy when enlarging)


MAYBE
. visualization of other saved bookings info on time selection in 'timelapse'
